    "\n",
    "- Which factors (e.g., Age, MonthlyIncome, JobRole, WorkLifeBalance, OverTime) are most associated with attrition?\n",
    "- Can we build a model to predict which employees are likely to leave within the next 6–12 months?\n",
    "- Do performance ratings correlate with attrition, and does that relationship vary by job role or tenure?\n",
    "- How does compensation (salary, stock options, percent salary hike) relate to voluntary attrition?\n",
    "- Are there observable churn patterns by department, job level, or job role?\n",
    "- Does overtime or business travel frequency increase attrition risk?\n",
    "- How does training time or number of training courses completed affect retention and performance?\n",
    "- Are there seasonal or hiring-cohort effects in attrition (e.g., hires in certain years more likely to leave)?\n",
    "- What employee segments (clusters) exist based on demographics, performance, and engagement metrics?\n",
    "- Can we identify early-warning indicators (changes in satisfaction, environment, or workload) before an employee leaves?\n",
    "- Does manager effectiveness (e.g., ManagerID patterns or team-level attrition rates) predict individual attrition?\n",
    "- How do promotion history and time-in-role affect both performance and attrition risk?\n",
    "- Are there pay inequities across gender/ethnicity that correlate with attrition or performance?\n",
    "- What is the survival curve (time-to-attrition) for different employee groups?\n",
    "- Can dimensionality reduction (PCA/UMAP) reveal structure or outliers in employee profiles?\n",
